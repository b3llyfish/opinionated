[h1] Opinionated [/2]
Mod that tweaks certain opinion modifiers and define properties to create more strife between incompatible characters.

This mod is largely for my own personal use so any values altered by it may be subject to change.

[h2] Key Features [/h2]
* Opinion modifiers between family members has been greatly decreased
* Max opinion penalty from cultural acceptance has been increased
* Increased penalty from faith doctrine violations (e.g. witchcraft, adultery)
* Increased penalty from having sinful traits
* Penalty between opposite personality traits has been doubled

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
This mod overwrites the base game personality traits as well as several define properties (see `Details` section below).

If another mod also updates these files then whichever mod is loaded last will take effect.

Other than that this mod should be compatible with everything.
